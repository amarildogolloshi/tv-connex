# Connex

Connex rules:

Start at 1; draw a single continuous path through every cell.
Visit numbered cells in ascending order: 1→2→…→N (you can pass through non‑numbered cells between numbers).
Fill every cell exactly once (Hamiltonian path on grid).
Walls between cells block movement—your path cannot cross them.
(Zip uses bold lines as walls; we’ll model them identically.)
